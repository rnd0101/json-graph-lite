Lightweight library for JSON graph 
==================================

A practical subset for:

https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification

Multigraphs are not supported.

Code here follows some conventions from:

https://github.com/jsongraph/jsongraph.py

However, nothing substantial has been borrowed from there.

The intention of json-graph-lite is to provide lightweight graph library, which serializes
and deserializes graphs as JSON graph format.
